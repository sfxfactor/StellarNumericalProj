This stellar evolution package is meant as a learning tool.  There
are many things that can be improved, e.g. opacity, equation of state,
nuclear burning, etc. and the routines are not always optimized for
performance or accuracy.

On a unix machine the following should calculate the evolution of a
1 solar mass star from the "birthline" (standard composition, 
equilibrium deuterium burning) to well into the red giant phase
at the beginning of core helium burning...

$ make all
$ polytr < polytr1.inp
$ stellar < pmsstar1.start > pmsstar1.lst
$ stellar < pmsstar1.inp >> pmsstar1.lst

The .inp file is set up to run 500 models at a time.

The evolution of a 3 solar mass star from the birthline well into
helium shell burning is calculated with

$ polytr < polytr3.inp
$ stellar < pmsstar3.start > pmsstar3.lst
$ stellar < pmsstar3.inp >> pmsstar3.lst

The .inp file is set up to continue running until the
program reaches an error exit.
